# R Methods of Data Reporting

This repository contains my two final projects completed for my Methods of Data Reporting in R course. The course focused on using R and the `tidyverse` to produce clean, communicative, and reproducible data reports, with a strong emphasis on visual storytelling and good code practices.

Each report was written in R Markdown, and was presented as part of the final assessment.

## What I Learned

###  Visualization & designing plots
- Creating aesthetic, readable plots using `ggplot2`
- Handling proportions, trends, distributions, and uncertainty
- Handling overplotting, faceting, and scaling
- Interactive and animated graphics with `plotly` and `gganimate`
- Visualizing geospatial data and multi-variable relationships

###  Best practises for data reporting
- Writing fully reproducible R Markdown documents
- Hiding code and warnings in the final rendered reports
- Following tidyverse principles: `%>%` pipelines, `mutate()` over `df$var <-`, and reusable code
- Building functions to avoid repetition
- Structuring reports with insights and minimal clutter

## Projects

### 1.  Food Supply & Obesity
The first report explores and analyses global food supply patterns and their relationship with obesity rates across countries and income groups.
- Uses grouped summaries and custom themes
- Emphasizes clear comparisons across World Bank income levels
- Applies `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `scales`

### 2. Employee Attrition Report
The second report is an analysis of HR data to identify drivers of employee attrition.
- Uses density plots, bar charts, and facet wrapping
- Applies filtering, grouping, and clear aesthetic design
- Focuses on presentation and narrative clarity
