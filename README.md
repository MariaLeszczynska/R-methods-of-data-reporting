# R Methods of Data Reporting

This repository contains my two final projects completed for my Methods of Data Reporting in R course. The course focused on using R and the `tidyverse` to produce clean, communicative, and reproducible data reports, with a strong emphasis on visual storytelling and good code practices.

## Projects (report html links below):

### 1. [Food Data - Milk](https://marialeszczynska.github.io/R-methods-of-data-reporting/food_presentation.html)  
The first report compares different types of milk to assess their nutritional content and determine which type may be the healthiest.

### 2. [Employee Attrition](https://marialeszczynska.github.io/R-methods-of-data-reporting/employeees_presentation.html)
The second report explores various factors related to employee turnover, helping identify key patterns and potential strategies for retention.

## What I Learned

###  Visualization & designing plots
- Creating aesthetic, readable plots using `ggplot2`
- Handling proportions, trends, distributions, and uncertainty
- Handling overplotting, faceting, and scaling
- Interactive and animated graphics with `plotly` and `gganimate`
- Visualizing geospatial data and multi-variable relationships

###  Best practises for data reporting
- Writing fully reproducible R Markdown documents
- Hiding code and warnings in the final rendered reports
- Following tidyverse principles: `%>%` pipelines, `mutate()` over `df$var <-`, and reusable code
- Building functions to avoid repetition
- Structuring reports with insights and minimal clutter
